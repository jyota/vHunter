Basic 2D scrolling Python game with "map" editor

Sample usage of engine: python engine.py level1.map

Sample usage of editor (existing map): python mapedit.py level1.map

Sample usage of editor (new map): python mapedit.py 64 64 tiles.png newlevel.map newlevel.scr

This is mainly work towards a prototype for a game, definitely not ready for 'showtime'!

Requires: 

-Pygame library 

-example graphics files, maps, etc. the graphics definitely not mine but included for an example.

-eztext.py (eztext included, grabbed from here http://www.pygame.org/project-EzText-920-.html)
